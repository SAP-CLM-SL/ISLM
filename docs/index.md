### Exercise

In this exercise, we are using GPT-4 large multimodal model to generate an email for sales order confirmation. Sales executive will use the Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM) framework to create and operate the ML use case.


ISLM is the single-entry point within SAP S/4HANA to efficiently integrate and operate machine learning scenarios. ISLM is being enhanced to act as application integration component between the applications and generative AI hub in SAP AI Core. ISLM is part of the standard SAP S/4HANA license, included in SAP BASIS Component, and available from SAP S/4HANA 2020 FPS0 and SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2011 onward.

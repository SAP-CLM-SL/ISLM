# Scenario storyline: Predict the plane type of an aircraft using Data Attribute Recommendation

# Overview

In this exercise, we are going to predict the plane type of an aircraft using SAP BTP based ML service Data Attribute Recommendation. We will use the Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM) framework to create and operate the ML use case.

Data Attribute Recommendation uses machine learning to predict and classify data records.
With Data Attribute Recommendation you can

- Automate and speed up data management processes
- Reduce errors and manual efforts in data maintenance
- Increase data consistency and accuracy

This exercise includes the following steps:

1. Create and publish an Intelligent Scenario.
2. Set up the connection for the Intelligent Scenario to connect to BTP based ML service.
3. Use Intelligent Scenario Management app to train, view model quality, deploy and activate the model.
4. View the inference result returned by the model in an ABAP report.
